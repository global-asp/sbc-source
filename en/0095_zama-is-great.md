# Zama is great!

##
My little brother sleeps very late. I wake early, because I am great!

##
I am the one who lets in the sun.

##
"You're my morning star," says Ma.

##
I wash myself, I don't need any help.

##
I can cope with cold water and blue smelly soap.

##
Ma reminds, "Don't forget teeth." I reply, "Never, not me!"

##
After washing, I greet Grandpa and Auntie, and wish them a good day.

##
Then I dress myself, "I'm big now Ma," I say.

##
I can close my buttons and buckle my shoes.

##
And I make sure little brother knows all the school news.

##
In class I do my best in every way.

##
I do all these good things every day. But the thing I like most, is to play and play!
