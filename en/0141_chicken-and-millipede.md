# Chicken and Millipede

##
Chicken and Millipede were friends. But they were always competing with each other. One day they decided to play football to see who the best player was.

##
They went to the football field and started their game. Chicken was fast, but Millipede was faster. Chicken kicked far, but Millipede kicked further. Chicken started to feel grumpy.

##
They decided to play a penalty shoot-out. First Millipede was goal keeper. Chicken scored only one goal. Then it was the chicken's turn to defend the goal.

##
Millipede kicked the ball and scored.

Millipede dribbled the ball and scored. Millipede headed the ball and scored. Millipede scored five goals.

##
Chicken was furious that she lost. She was a very bad loser. Millipede started laughing because his friend was making such a fuss.

##
Chicken was so angry that she opened her beak wide and swallowed the millipede.

##
As Chicken was walking home, she met Mother Millipede. Mother Millipede asked, "Have you seen my child?" Chicken didn't say anything.

Mother Millipede was worried.

##
Then Mother Millipede heard a tiny voice. "Help me mom!" cried the voice. Mother Millipede looked around and listened carefully. The voice came from inside the chicken.

##
Mother Millipede shouted, "Use your special power my child!" Millipedes can make a bad smell and a terrible taste. Chicken began to feel ill.

##
Chicken burped. Then she swallowed and spat. Then she sneezed and coughed. And coughed. The millipede was disgusting!

##
Chicken coughed until she coughed out the millipede that was in her stomach. Mother Millipede and her child crawled up a tree to hide.

##
From that time, chickens and millipedes were enemies.
