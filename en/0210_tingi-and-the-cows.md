# Tingi and the cows

##
Tingi lived with his grandmother.

##
He used to look after the cows with her.

##
One day the soldiers came.

##
They took the cows away.

##
Tingi and his grandmother ran away and hid.

##
They hid in the bush until night.

##
Then the soldiers came back.

##
Grandmother hid Tingi under the leaves.

##
One of the soldiers put his foot right on him, but he kept quiet.

##
When it was safe, Tingi and his grandmother came out.

##
They crept home very quietly.
