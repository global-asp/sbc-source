# Goat, Dog, and Cow

##
Goat, Dog, and Cow
were great friends. One
day they went on a
journey in a taxi.

##
When they reached the
end of their journey, the
driver asked them to
pay their fares. Cow
paid her fare.

##
Dog paid a bit extra,
because he did not
have the correct money.

##
The driver was about to
give Dog his change
when Goat ran away
without paying
anything.

##
The driver was very
annoyed. He drove
away without giving
Dog his change.

##
That is why, even
today, Dog runs
towards a car to peep
inside and find the
driver who owes him his
change.

##
Goat runs away from
the sound of a car. She
is afraid she will be
arrested for not paying
her fare.

##
And Cow is not
bothered when a car is
coming. Cow takes her
time crossing the road
because she knows she
paid her fare in full.
