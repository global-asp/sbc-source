# Khalai talks to plants

##
This is Khalai. She is seven years old. Her name means 'the good one' in her language, Lubukusu.

##
Khalai wakes up and talks to the orange tree. "Please orange tree, grow big and give us lots of ripe oranges."

##
Khalai walks to school. On the way she talks to the grass. "Please grass, grow greener and don't dry up."

##
Khalai passes wild flowers. "Please flowers, keep blooming so I can put you in my hair."

##
At school, Khalai talks to the tree in the middle of the compound. "Please tree, put out big branches so we can read under your shade."

##
Khalai talks to the hedge around her school. "Please grow strong and stop bad people from coming in."

##
When Khalai returns home from school, she visits the orange tree. "Are your oranges ripe yet?" asks Khalai.

##
"The oranges are still green," sighs Khalai. "I will see you tomorrow orange tree," says Khalai. "Perhaps then you will have a ripe orange for me!"
