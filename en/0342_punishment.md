# Punishment

##
One day, mama got a lot of fruit.

##
"When can we have some fruit?" we ask.

"We will have the fruit tonight," says mama.

##
My brother Rahim is greedy. He tastes all the fruit. He eats a lot of it.

##
"Look at what Rahim did!" shouts my little brother.

"Rahim is naughty and selfish," I say.

##
Mother is angry with Rahim.

##
We are also angry with Rahim. But Rahim is not sorry.

##
"Aren't you going to punish Rahim?" asks little brother.

##
"Rahim, soon you will be sorry," warns mama.

##
Rahim starts to feel sick.

##
"My tummy is so sore," whispers Rahim.

##
Mama knew this would happen. The fruit is punishing Rahim!

##
Later, Rahim says sorry to us. "I will never be so greedy again," he promises.

And we all believe him.
